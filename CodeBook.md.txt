# Variables

1. Imported data sets are saved with the same name as the text file:
features
activity_labels
X_train
y_train
X_test
y_test
subject_train
subject_test
total_acc_x_train
total_acc_x_train
total_acc_z_train
body_acc_x_train
body_acc_y_train
body_acc_z_train
body_gyro_x_train
body_gyro_y_train
body_gyro_z_train
total_acc_x_test
total_acc_x_test
total_acc_z_test
body_acc_x_test
body_acc_y_test
body_acc_z_test
body_gyro_x_test
body_gyro_y_test
body_gyro_z_test

2. Train and test data sets are merged to new data set with no "train" or "test" suffix:
x
y
subject
total_acc_x
total_acc_x
total_acc_z
body_acc_x
body_acc_y
body_acc_z
body_gyro_x
body_gyro_y
body_gyro_z

3. Transformed variables
names: auxiliary data set containing the feature names
ext : extracted data set with columns containing the means and standard deviation of features, the subject label and activity name
means: averages of extracted data set by subject and activity name

# Data

The final data set "means" exported as "averages.txt" to the working directory contains the averages of extracted features from initial data set by subject and performed activity. It has got 180 observations and 68 variables:

activity : name of the activity performed by the subject (eg. walking, standing, sitting, laying, etc)
subjectLabel : label of the subject describing the person who performed the activity. Value range between 1-30

The following columns are variables from the measurements of accelerometer

# Transformations

run_analysis.R performs the following steps until reaching the final, exported dataset:

1. the imported train and test data sets are merged together under the same name as of the input files with no train or test suffix. Eg. x, y, subject, total_acc_x, etc.
2. The column names of x are replaced by the ones in "features.txt"
3. The column names of subject data set are also changed to more descriptive names
4. Subject label column is added to x. (data sets from 2. and 3. are combined
5. Activity label column is added to x.
6. Features containing means and standard deviation are extracted to "ext" data set, as well as the subject and activity labels
7. Data from "ext" data set is aggregated by subject and activity using the "Mean" function to calculate their averages and saved to "means" data set
8. "means" data set is exported to "averages.txt"
